VIII. SEARCHES AND SEIZURES
160. CDP will conduct all investigatory stops, searches, and arrests with the goal of ensuring
that they are conducted in accordance with the rights secured and protected by the
Constitution and state and federal law. CDP will conduct investigatory stops, searches,
and arrests fairly and respectfully as part of an effective overall crime prevention
strategy that takes into account community values. To achieve this goal, CDP will
revise, develop, and implement search and seizure policies that comply with applicable
law, and include the requirements below.
161. Officers will not use an individual's gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, or
perceived sexual orientation as a factor, to any extent or degree, in establishing
reasonable suspicion or probable cause, unless such information is part of an actual and
credible description of a specific suspect in an investigation that includes other
identifying factors.
162. Officers will not conduct investigatory stops when they lack reasonable suspicion.
163. Officers will not conduct pat down searches without specific and articulable facts to
reasonably suspect that a particular person is armed and dangerous. This does not
restrict an officer's ability to conduct a search incident to arrest or prior to transport.
164. Where an officer seeks consent for a search, the officer will inform the person of his or
her right to refuse and to revoke consent at any time and document the person's
consent.
165. CDP officers will not rely solely upon an individual's geographic location, or presence
in a high crime area without any other specific and articulable facts indicating that the
individual has been, is, or is about to engage in criminal activity, as the basis for an
investigatory stop.
166. Officers will immediately notify a supervisor when effectuating a custodial arrest for
obstructing official business, resisting arrest, or assaulting an officer and no other
substantive violation is alleged. Upon notification, the supervisor will respond to the
scene.
167. Officers will not use "canned" or conclusory language without supporting detail in
documents or reports documenting investigatory stops, searches, or arrests.
168. Officers will articulate the justification for an investigatory stop, search, or arrest in a
specific and clear manner in their reports. CDP will train officers to use specific and
individualized descriptive language in reports when documenting investigatory stops,
searches, and arrests. Supervisors will review all documentation of investigatory stops,
searches, and arrests for completeness and adherence to law and CDP policy.
169. CDP supervisors will review each arrest report by officers under their command,
whether or not they involve the seizure of contraband, and will sign off on those reports
to memorialize their review within 24 hours of the arrest, absent exceptional
circumstances. Supervisors will review reports and forms for deficiencies including:
a. "canned" or conclusory language without supporting detail, inconsistent
information, insufficient articulation of the legal basis for the action, or other
indicia that the information in the reports or forms is not correct or complete;
b. arrests following stops that were not supported by reasonable suspicion;
c. arrests that are not supported by probable cause, or are otherwise in violation
of the law or CDP policy; and
d. for every search or arrest involving the recovery of contraband evidence,
whether the circumstances by which the evidence was recovered and/or
probable cause for arrest was established are plausible and complete.
170. Within seven days, CDP supervisors will separately document and report:
(1) investigatory stops and pat-down searches that appear unsupported by reasonable
suspicion, or that are otherwise in violation of CDP policy; (2) arrests unsupported by
probable cause or that are in violation of CDP policy; or (3) investigatory stops,
searches, and arrests that, while comporting with law and policy, indicate a need for
corrective action or review of agency policy, strategy, tactics, or training.
171. CDP supervisors will take appropriate action to address all apparent violations or
deficiencies in investigatory stops, searches, and arrests. Appropriate action may
include recommending non-disciplinary corrective action for the involved officer, or
referring the incident for administrative or criminal investigation. The supervisor will
ensure that each violation or deficiency is addressed in the officer's performance
evaluations.
172. A command-level official will review, within seven days of their completion, all
supervisory reports of investigatory stops and pat-down searches not supported by
reasonable suspicion, all searches and arrests not supported by probable cause, and all
investigatory stops, searches, and arrests that were in violation of CDP policy, or that
indicated a need for corrective action or review of agency policy, strategy, tactics, or
training. The commander will evaluate the supervisor's assessment and
recommendations and ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken, including
referring the incident to Internal Affairs for investigation, if warranted. The
commander also will take appropriate non-disciplinary corrective action and/or will
initiate the disciplinary process against supervisors who fail to conduct complete,
thorough, and accurate reviews of officers' investigatory stops, searches, and arrests.
CDP will take into account the quality and completeness of these supervisory and
commander reviews of officers' investigatory stops, searches, and arrests, in
supervisory and commander perfomance evaluations.
173. CDP will provide all officers with initial training that is adequate in quality, quantity,
scope, and type on investigatory stops, searches, and arrests, including the requirements
of this Agreement. The training will be taught by a qualified instructor with significant
experience in Fourth Amendment issues. The training will address the requirements of
Fourth Amendment and related law, CDP policies, and this Agreement, including:
a. the difference among the scope and degree of intrusion associated with
different types of police contacts; the difference between probable cause,
reasonable suspicion, and mere speculation; and the difference between
voluntary consent and the mere acquiescence to police authority;
b. the types of facts and circumstances that may be considered in initiating,
conducting, terminating, and expanding an investigatory stop;
c. the level of permissible intrusion when conducting searches, such as
"pat-downs" or "frisks";
d. the permissible nature and scope of searches incident to an arrest;
e. procedures for executing searches, including handling, recording, and taking
custody of seized property and evidence; and
f. the principles of procedural justice and the effect that differing approaches to
investigatory stops, searches, and arrests can have on community perceptions
of police legitimacy and public safety.
174. CDP also will provide officers with annual search and seizure in-service training that is
adequate in quality, quantity, type, and scope.
175. CDP will incorporate the following elements in its training of officers: (1) if possible, introducing themselves at the initiation of contact with a civillan; (2) stating the reason
for an investigatory stop as soon as practicable; (3) ensuring that an investigatory stop
is no longer than necessary to take appropriate action; and (4) acting with
professionalism and courtesy throughout the interaction.




XIV. IMPLEMENTATION, ASSESSMENT, OUTCOMES, AND ENFORCEMENT
A. Role of the Independent Monitor
350. The Parties will jointly select an Independent Monitor ("Monitor") who will assess and
report whether the requirements of this Agreement have been implemented, and
whether this implementation is resulting in constitutional and effective policing,
professional treatment of individuals, and increased community trust of CDP. The
Monitor will work with the Parties to identify and address any barriers to compliance.
351. The Monitor will only have the duties, responsibilities, and authority conferred by this
Agreement. The Monitor will not, and is not intended to, replace or assume the role
and duties of any CDP employee, including the Chief, or any other City official.
Nothing in this Agreement alters the fact that the Mayor of Cleveland retains authority
over the CDP and the Chief of CDP maintains the authority to oversee the operations of
CDP. As an agent of the Court, the Monitor will be subject to the supervision and
orders of the Court, consistent with this Agreement and applicable law.
352. In order to assess and report on CDP's implementation of this Agreement and whether
the goals of this Agreement are being achieved, the Monitor will conduct the reviews
specified in this Agreement, and will review CDP policies, procedures, practices,
training curricula, and programs developed and implemented under this Agreement.
B. Selection and Compensation of the Monitor
353. Within 90 days of the Effective Date, or additional time if agreed to by the Parties, the
City and DOJ will together select a Monitor, acceptable to both Parties, to assess and
report on CDP's implementation of this Agreement. The Parties have agreed to use an
open Request for Information process in selecting the Monitor. This process will be
implemented in a manner consistent with this Agreement, including the requirement
that the Monitor be jointly selected and acceptable to both DOJ and the City. The
Parties' Monitor selection will be subject to the approval of the Court with jurisdiction
over this Agreement. The Monitor will be comprised of individuals of the highest
ethics.
354. If the Parties are unable to agree on a Monitor or an alternative method of selection
within the timeframe agreed to by the Parties, each Party will submit the names of three
candidates, or three groups of candidates, along with resumes and cost proposals, to the
Court, and the Court will select a Monitor from among the qualified
candidates/candidate groups.
355. The Monitor will be appointed for a period of five years from the Effective Date and
will have its appointment extended automatically should the City and CDP not
demonstrate Substantial and Effective Compliance at the end of this five-year period.
The extension of the Monitor beyond seven years will be allowed only if the Court
determines that it is reasonably necessary in order to assess and facilitate Substantial
and Effective Compliance with this Agreement. The Monitor's appointment will
terminate prior to five years if the City has achieved Substantial and Effective
Compliance for the time specified in paragraph 401.
356. The City will bear all reasonable fees and costs of the Monitor. DOJ and the City
recognize the importance of ensuring that the fees and costs borne by the City are
reasonable, and accordingly fees and costs will be one factor to be considered in
selecting the Monitor. In the event that any dispute arises regarding the reasonableness
or payment of the Monitor's fees and costs, the City, DOJ, and the Monitor will attempt
to resolve such dispute cooperatively prior to seeking the assistance of the Court. If the
City and DOJ agree, and the Court approves, an independent third party with no
financial interest in the case may pay some or all of the fees and costs of the Monitor.
357. The City will provide the Monitor with permanent office space and reasonable office
support such as office furniture, telephones, Internet access, secure document storage,
and photocopying.
358. The Monitor, at any time after its initial selection, may request to be allowed to hire,
employ, or contract with such additional persons or entities as are reasonably necessary
to perform the tasks assigned to the Monitor by this Agreement. Any person or entity
hired or otherwise retained by the Monitor to assist in furthering any provision of this
Agreement will be subject to the provisions of this Agreement. The Monitor will notify
the City and DOJ in writing if the Monitor wishes to select such additional persons or
entities. The notice will identify and describe the qualifications of the person or entity
to be hired or employed and the monitoring task to be performed. If the City and DOJ
agree with the Monitor's proposal, the Monitor will be authorized to hire or employ
such additional persons or entities. The City and the DOJ have ten business days to
disagree with any such proposal. If the City and DOJ are unable to reach agreement
within ten business days of receiving notice of the disagreement, the Court will resolve
the dispute.
359. Should any of the Parties to this Agreement determine that the Monitor's individual
members, agents, employees, or independent contractors have exceeded their authority,
or failed to satisfactorily perfonn the duties required by this Agreement, the Party may
petition the Court for such relief as the Court deems appropriate, including replacement of the Monitor, and/or any individual members, agents, employees, or independent contractors.
C. Compliance Reviews
360. The Monitor will conduct reviews or audits as necessary to determine whether the City
and CDP have complied with the requirements of this Agreement. Compliance requires
that the City and CDP: (a) have incorporated the requirement into policy; (b) have
trained all relevant personnel as necessary to fulfill their responsibilities pursuant to the
requirement; and (c) are carrying out the requirement in actual practice. Compliance
reviews and audits will contain the elements necessary for reliability and
comprehensiveness. Compliance reviews and audits may be conducted using sampling
and compilation data where appropriate.
D. Biennial Community Survey
361. Within 180 days of the Effective Date, and every two years thereafter, the Monitor will
conduct a reliable, comprehensive, and representative survey of members of the
Cleveland community regarding their experiences with and perceptions of CDP and of
public safety. Analysis of the results of this survey will be included in the outcome
assessments that are described in paragraph 367 and that may be used to demonstrate
sustained compliance with this Agreement.
362. The City and DOJ will endeavor to secure private funding for the biennial community
survey.
363. To conduct the biennial community survey, the Monitor will :
a. develop a baseline of measures on public satisfaction with policing, attitudes
among police personnel, and the quality of police-citizen encounters;
b. design, conduct, and analyze baseline and subsequent biennial surveys of a
representative sample of City residents, police personnel, and detained
arrestees;
c. review and consider prior law enforcement surveys in Cleveland and other
cities, as well as current or recent concerns in Cleveland, in designing the
survey;
d. observe community meetings and engage in informal conversations with
Cleveland residents, CDP officers and command staff, and other relevant
individuals, including DOJ representatives during the pendency of this
Agreement;
e. ensure that the resident and arrestee surveys are designed to capture a
representative sample of Cleveland residents, including members of each
demographic category;
f. conduct the survey in English, Spanish, and other languages, as necessary, to
ensure representation of the entire Cleveland community; and
g. formally discuss the survey methodology with CDP supervisors and DOJ
representatives, throughout the pcndency of this Agreement, and consider
these opinions in the development of the initial survey and in making
improvements to subsequent surveys.
364. CDP and the City agree to cooperate with the design and perfonnance of the survey.
365. The report of the baseline survey and subsequent biennial surveys will be posted to the
City's website, and publicly distributed.
366. CDP will analyze the results of the survey and will use this analysis to modify and
improve CDP policies, procedures, practices, and protocols, as needed.
E. Outcome Measurements
367. In addition to compliance reviews and audits, the Monitor will conduct qualitative and
quantitative assessments to measure whether implementing this Agreement has resulted
in constitutional policing. The measurements relating to use of force; addressing
individuals in crisis; and stop, search, and arrest are not intended to expand the City's
data collection requirements set forth elsewhere in the Agreement. These outcome
assessments will include collecting and analyzing. at least annually, the following
outcome data, trends, and patterns:
a. Use of force measurements, including:
1. number of use-of-force incidents as compared to number of arrests, with
use-of-force incidents broken down by force type, District, type of related

8. other than vehicle accidents not involving a pursuit, number and nature of
civil suits against the City or CDP officers for work related conduct, and
the amount of judgments against or settlements resulting from those civil
suits.
J. In conducting these outcome assessments, the Monitor may use any relevant
data collected and maintained by CDP or the City (e.g., crime trend pattern
analysis), provided that the Monitor has determined, and the Parties agree, that
this data is reasonably reliable and complete.
F. Monitoring Plan and Review Methodology
368. Within 90 days of assuming the duties as the Monitor, the Monitor will review and
recommend any changes to the outcome measures detailed above that the Monitor
deems useful in assessing whether implementation of this Agreement is resulting in
constitutional policing. Recognizing that the above outcome measures have been
negotiated and agreed to by the Parties, the Parties will move the Court to adopt any
recommendations upon which they agree.
369. Within 120 days of assuming the duties as the Monitor, the Monitor will develop a plan
for conducting the compliance reviews and outcome assessments, and will submit this
plan to the Parties for review and approval. This plan will:
a. clearly delineate the requirements of this Agreement to be assessed for
compliance, indicating which requirements will be assessed together;
b. set out a schedule for conducting outcome measure assessments for each outcome
measure at least annually, except where otherwise noted, with the first assessment
occurring within 365 days of the Effective Date; and
c. set out a schedule for conducting a compliance review or audit of each
requirement of this Agreement within the first two years of this Agreement, and a
compliance review or audit of each requirement at least annually thereafter, unless
the Monitor no longer assesses that requirement as provided in the next
paragraph.
370. Where the Monitor recommends and the Parties agree, the Monitor may refrain from
conducting a compliance review of a requirement previously found to be in compliance
by the Monitor, or where outcome assessments indicate that the outcome intended by
the requirement has been achieved. The City and CDP will be deemed to have
achieved Substantial and Effective Compliance on those requirements and the City's
obligations under those provisions will be deemed to have been met for the purpose of
seeking termination of this Agreement, without considering the one or two year
sustained compliance requirement.
37 1. At least 90 days prior to the initiation or any outcome measure assessment, compliance
review, or audit, the Monitor will submit a proposed methodology for the assessment,
review, or audit to the Parties. The Parties will submit any comments or concerns
regarding the proposed methodology to the Monitor no later than 45 days prior to the
proposed date of the assessment, review, or audit. The Monitor will modify the
methodology as necessary to address any concerns or will inform the Parties in writing
or the reasons it is not modifying its proposed methodology. Any unresolved disputes
involving the Monitor's methodology may be submitted to the Court for resolution.
G. Monitor Recommendations and Technical Assistance
372. The Monitor may make recommendations to the Parties regarding actions necessary to
ensure timely Substantial and Effective compliance with this Agreement and its
underlying objectives. Such recommendations may include a recommendation to
change, modify, or amend a provision of this Agreement, a recommendation for
additional training in any area related to this Agreement, or a recommendation to seek
technical assistance. In addition to such recommendations, the Monitor may also, at the
request of DOJ or the City and based on the Monitor's reviews, provide technical
assistance consistent with the Monitor's responsibilities under this Agreement.
373. In the event that Substantial and Effective Compliance with this Agreement requires
technical assistance beyond the scope of the Monitor's duties, DOJ, CDP, and/or the
Monitor will inform the Parties of the need for technical assistance and its relation to
compliance with this Agreement. The Monitor, with assistance from the City, will
arrange for the prompt initiation of the required technical assistance, to be performed
by the Monitor, its agent, independent contractor, or a separate entity. The cost for the
technical assistance will be borne by the City. If any Party disagrees with the need for
the requested technical assistance, the Party will, within IS days of being informed in
writing of the requested technical assistance, inform the Court, which will resolve the
dispute.
H. Comprehensive Reassessment
374. Two years and six months after the Effective Date, the Monitor will conduct a
comprehensive outcome assessment to determine whether and to what extent the
outcomes intended by this agreement are being achieved, and whether any
modifications to this Agreement are necessary for achievement in light of changed
circumstances or unanticipated impact (or lack of impact) of the requirement. The
Monitoring Plan will provide that this comprehensive outcome assessment will
coincide with an annual outcome assessment as required in paragraph 367. This
assessment also will address areas of greatest achievement and the requirements that
appear to have contributed to this success, as well as areas of greatest concern,
including strategies for accelerating Substantial and Effective Compliance. Based upon
this comprehensive assessment, the Monitor will recommend any modifications to this
Agreement necessary to achieve and sustain intended outcomes. Where the Parties
agree with the Monitor's recommendations, the Parties will move the Court to modify
this Agreement accordingly. This provision in no way diminishes the Parties' ability to
stipulate to modifications to this Agreement as set out below. Nothing in this
Assessment will enable the Monitor to unilaterally modify the terms of this Agreement.
I. Monitor Reports
375. The Monitor will file with the Court, every six months, written, public reports that
include the following:
a. a description of the work conducted by the Monitor during the reporting
period;
b. a list of each Agreement requirement, indicating which requirements have
been:
1. incorporated into policy;
2. the subject of sufficient training for all relevant CDP officers and
employees; and
3. carried out in actual practice.
c. the methodology and specific findings for each compliance review conducted,
where appropriate, and redacted as necessary for privacy concerns. An
unredacted version will be filed under seal with the Court and provided to the
Parties. The underlying data for each compliance review will not be publicly
available but will be retained by the Monitor and provided to either or both
Parties upon request;
d. for any requirements that were reviewed or audited and found not to have
been implemented, the Monitor's recommendations regarding necessary steps
to achieve compliance;
e. the methodology and specific findings for each outcome assessment
conducted; and
f. a projection of the work to be completed during the upcoming reporting
period and any anticipated challenges or concerns related to compliance with
this Agreement.
376. The Monitor will provide a copy of the six-month reports to the Parties in draft form
within 15 business days after the end of each reporting period. The Parties will have 15
business days upon receipt of the report to informally comment on the draft report. The
Monitor will consider the Parties' responses and make appropriate changes, if any,
before issuing the report.
J. Coordination with the Police Inspector General
377. In conducting its assessments, reviews, and audits, and in developing its monitoring
plan and review methodologies, the Monitor may coordinate and confer with the Police
Inspector General to avoid duplication of effort and expenses.
K. Communication between Monitor, Parties, and Public
378. The Monitor will maintain regular contact with the Parties in order to ensure effective
and timely communication regarding the status of CDP's compliance with this
Agreement. To facilitate this communication, the Monitor will conduct monthly
meetings, which will include participation by the Chief, counsel for the City, CDP's
Consent Decree Implementation Unit (described below), and DOJ. The Monitor also
will meet at least twice each year with the Mayor.
379. The Monitor will hold public meetings with community stakeholders, including the
Commission and the Cleveland City Council, to explain the Monitor's reports and
inform the public about this Agreement's implementation process, as well as to hear
community perspectives of police interactions. The Monitor will notify the Parties
when such meetings are scheduled.
L. Public Statements, Testimony, Records, and Conflicts of Interest
380. Except as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or with the Parties
acting together: the Monitor, including any agent, employee, or independent contractor
thereof, will not make any public statements or issue findings with regard to any act or
omission of the City or CDP, or their agents, representatives, or employees; or disclose
non-public information provided to the Monitor pmsuant to this Agreement. Any press
statement made by the Monitor regarding its employment or monitoring activities under
this Agreement first will be approved by DOJ and the City.
381. The Monitor, including any agent, employee, or independent contractor thereof: may
testify as to its/their observations, findings, and recommendations before the Court with
jurisdiction over this matter. However, the Monitor, including any agent, employee, or
independent contractor thereof, will not testify in any other litigation or investigative or
pre-litigative proceeding with regard to any act or omission of the City, CDP, or any of
their agents, representatives, or employees related to this Agreement or regarding any
matter or subject of which the Monitor may have received knowledge as a result of
his/her performance under this Agreement. This paragraph does not apply to any
proceeding before a court related to performance of contracts or subcontracts for
monitoring this Agreement.
382. Unless such conflict is waived by the Parties, the Monitor will not accept employment
or provide consulting services that would present a conflict of interest with the
Monitor's responsibilities under this Agreement, including being retained (on a paid or
unpaid basis) by any current or future litigant or claimant, or such litigant's or
claimant's attorney, in connection with a claim or suit against the City or its
departments, officers, agents or employees.
383. The Monitor is not a state or local agency, or an agent thereof, and accordingly, the
records maintained by the Monitor will not be designated as public records subject to
public inspection.
384. The Monitor will not be liable for any claim, lawsuit, or demand arising out of the
Monitor's performance pursuant to this Agreement brought by non-parties to this
Agreement.
M. CDP Consent Decree Implementation Unit
385. The City and CDP agree to hire and retain, or reassign current City employees to form a
unit with the skills and abilities necessary to facilitate compliance with this Agreement.
At a minimum, this unit will coordinate the City's and CDP's compliance and
implementation activities; facilitate the provision of data, documents, materials, and
access to the City's and CDP's personnel to the Monitor and DOJ, as needed; ensure
that all data, documents and records are maintained as provided in this Agreement; and
assist in assigning implementation and compliance related tasks to CDP personnel, as
directed by the Chief or the Chief's designee.
N. Implementation Assessment and Report
386. The City and CDP agree to collect and maintain all data and records necessary
to: (I) document compliance with this Agreement, including data and records
necessary for the Monitor to conduct reliable outcome assessments, compliance
reviews, and audits; and (2) to allow CDP or other City entities to perform ongoing
quality assurance in each of the areas addressed by this Agreement.
387. Within 180 days of the Effective Date, the City will file with the Court, with a copy to
the Monitor and DOJ, a status report. This report will delineate the steps taken by CDP
during the reporting period to comply with this Agreement; CDP's assessment of the
status of its progress; plans to correct any problems; and responses to any concerns
raised in the Monitor's previous semi-annual report. Following this initial status report,
the City will file a status report every six months thereafter while this Agreement is in
effect.
O. Access and Confidentiality
388. To facilitate its work, the Monitor may conduct on-site visits and assessments without
prior notice to the City and CDP. CDP will notify the Monitor as soon as practicable,
and in any case within 12 hours, of any critical firearms discharge, in-custody death, or
arrest of any officer.
389. The Monitor will have timely, full, and direct access to all Agreement related
individuals, facilities, trainings, meetings, disciplinary hearings, reviews, and the scene
of any occurrence that the Monitor reasonably deems necessary to carry out the duties
assigned to the Monitor by this Agreement. The Monitor will cooperate with the City
and CDP to access people, scenes, and facilities in a reasonable manner that, consistent
with the Monitor's responsibilities, minimizes interference with daily operations.
390. The City and CDP will ensure that the Monitor will have full and direct access to all
City and CDP documents and data related to the Agreement that the Monitor
reasonably deems necessary to carry out the duties assigned to the Monitor by this
Agreement, except any doctuments or data protected by work product or the
attorney-client privilege (together "privilege"). Privilege may not be used to prevent
the Monitor from observing trainings, disciplinary hearings, or reviews, other than
reviews with City lawyers in anticipation of litigation or for litigation. Should the City
and CDP decline to provide the Monitor with access to documents or data based on
privilege, the City and CDP will inform the Monitor and DOJ that it is withholding
documents or data on this basis, and will provide the Monitor and DOJ with a log
describing the documents or data and the basis of the privilege . If DOJ objects to the
City's classification, DOJ may seek resolution of the propriety of the assertion of the
privilege from the Court.
391. DOJ and its consultants and agents will have full and direct access to all City and CDP
staff, employees, facilities, documents, and data related to the Agreement, in
coordination with the Law Department of the City of Cleveland, except any documents
or data protected by work product or the attorney-client privilege (together "privilege").
DOJ and its consultants and agents will coordinate with the Law Department of the
City of Cleveland to access involved personnel, facilities, and documents in a
reasonable manner that, consistent with DOJ's right to seek enforcement of this
Agreement, minimizes interference with daily operations. Should the City or CDP
decline to provide DOJ with access to personnel, documents, or data based on privilege,
the City and CDP will inform DOJ that it is withholding personnel, documents, or data
on this basis, and will provide DOJ with a log describing the documents or data and the
basis for withholding. If DOJ objects to the City's classification, DOJ may seek
resolution of the propriety of the assertion from the Court.
392. While an administrative or criminal investigation into the conduct of an officer or
officers is ongoing, neither the Monitor nor DOJ will ask the subject officer(s) or
witness officer(s) questions related to the conduct that is under investigation.
393. The Monitor and DOJ will provide the City and CDP with reasonable notice of a
request for copies of documents. Upon such request, the City and CDP will provide
copies in a timely manner (electronic, where readily available) of the requested
documents to the Monitor and DOJ, unless withheld as privileged or otherwise withheld
pursuant to law as described above.
394. The Monitor will have access to all records and information relating to criminal
investigations of CDP officers as permitted by law. The Monitor will have access to all
documents in criminal investigation files that have been closed by CDP after the
Effective Date.
395. The Monitor and DOJ will maintain all confidential or non-public information provided
by the City and CDP in a confidential manner. Other than as expressly provided in this
Agreement, this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of any privilege or right the
City and CDP may assert, including those recognized at common law or created by
statute, rule, or regulation, against any other person or entity with respect to the
disclosure of any document.
P. Court Jurisdiction, Modification of this Agreement, and Enforcement
396. This Agreement will become effective upon entry by the Court.
397. The Court will retain jurisdiction of this action for all purposes until such time as the
City and CDP have achieved Substantial and Effective Compliance with this
Agreement and maintained such compliance for no less than two consecutive years. At
all times, the City and CDP will bear the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance
or the evidence its Substantial and Effective Compliance with this Agreement. DOJ
acknowledges the good faith of the City of Cleveland in trying to address actions that
are needed to promote police integrity and ensure constitutional policing. DOJ,
however, reserves its right to seek enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement if it
determines that the City and CDP have failed to substantially comply with any
provision of this Agreement. DOJ will consult with officials from the City before
instituting enforcement proceedings.
398. The City and DOJ may jointly agree to make changes, modifications, and amendments
to this Agreement, which will be effective if approved by the Court. Such changes,
modifications, and amendments to this Agreement will be encouraged when the Parties
agree, or where the Monitor's reviews, assessments, and/or audits demonstrate that an
Agreement provision as drafted is not furthering the purpose of this Agreement or that
there is a preferable alternative that will achieve the same purpose. Where the Parties
or the Monitor are uncertain whether a change to this Agreement is advisable, the
Parties may agree to suspend the current Agreement requirement for a time period
agreed upon at the outset of the suspension. During this suspension, the Parties may
agree to temporarily utilize an alternative requirement. The Monitor will assess
whether the suspension of the requirement, and the use of any alternative provision, is
as effective, or more effective al achieving the purpose as was the original/current
Agreement requirement, and the Parties will consider this assessment in determining
whether to jointly stipulate to make the suggested change, modification, or amendment.
399. The Parties agree to defend the provisions of this Agreement including in collective
bargaining. The Parties will notify each other of any court, union, or administrative
challenge to this Agreement. In the event any provision of this Agreement is
challenged in any city or state court, the Parties will seek removal to Federal Court.
400. The City and CDP agree to require compliance with this Agreement by their respective
officers, employees, agencies, assigns, or successors.
Q. Termination of this Agreement
401. This Agreement will terminate when the City has been in Substantial and Effective
Compliance with the search and seizure provisions for one year and with all of the
remaining provisions for two consecutive years. "Substantial and Effective
Compliance" means that the City either has complied with all material requirements of
this Agreement, or has achieved sustained and continuing improvement in
constitutional policing, as demonstrated pursuant to this Agreement's outcome
measures.
402. If the Parties disagree whether the City has been in Substantial and Effective
Compliance with the search and seizure provisions for one year and with all of the
remaining provisions for two consecutive years, the City may seek to terminate this
Agreement. Prior to filing a motion to terminate, the City agrees to notify DOJ in
writing when the City has determined that they are in Substantial and Effective
Compliance with this Agreement and that such compliance has been maintained for the
required time periods. Thereafter, the Parties will promptly confer as to the status of
compliance. If, after a reasonable period of consultation and the completion of any
audit or evaluation that DOJ and/or the Monitor may wish to undertake, including on-
site observations, document review, or interviews with the City and CDP's personnel,
the Parties cannot resolve any compliance issues, the City may file a motion to
terminate this Agreement. lf the City moves for termination of this Agreement, DOJ
will have 60 days after the receipt of the City's motion to object to the motion. If DOJ
does not object, the Court may grant the City's motion without a hearing. If DOJ does
object, the Court will hold a hearing on the motion, and the burden will be on the City
to demonstrate by the preponderance of the evidence that it is in Substantial and
Effective Compliance with this Agreement and has maintained such compliance for the
required time periods.
403. This Agreement is enforceable only by the Parties. No person or entity is intended to
be a third-party beneficiary of the provisions of this Agreement for purposes of any
civil, criminal, or administrative action. Accordingly, no person or entity may assert
any claim or right as a benefiiary or protected class under this Agreement.\
